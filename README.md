Project inspired from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library).


### Note to self

I made this project to learn about the basics of DOM manipulation and how to use local storage very long time ago, in 2021. And I was not sure if I will be updating this project in the future.

On January 2023, I have come back to this project to practice form validation using JavaScript as it is a
[warmup exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation-with-javascript#practice)
on TOP. I have also improved the UI a bit. Now it uses tailwindcss for styling. I am using the CDN version of tailwindcss because the project is small and I don't want to add a build step to it.
